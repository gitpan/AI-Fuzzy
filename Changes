	- found problem with stringifycation in Set.pm
	- fixed warning messages due to not checking "exists" for hash 
	  values in Set.pm (union,intersection).  Thanks to Richard Jelinek
	  for pointing this out, and a problem in the code in the docs.

        - replaced current AI::Fuzzy::Label with a new AI::Fuzzy::Axis (a container for label objects)
          and changed AI::Fuzzy::Label to be concerned only about label data.  This
          will allow us to add new AI::Fuzzy::Label{Spline, Trapezoid, etc.} subclasses
          of labels to the now independent Axis class.  Axis will defer to the Label
          itself to decide applicability, >,<,>=,<=, and the like.
        - changed test.pl to work with the new setup
        - added functions: greaterthan, greaterequal, lessthan, lessequal, and between
          to AI::Fuzzy::Label
        - added overriding of >,>=,<,<=, and <=> in AI::Fuzzy::Label.
